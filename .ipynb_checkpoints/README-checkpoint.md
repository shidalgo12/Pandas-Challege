# Pandas Coding

Read and analyzed a .csv file via Pandas coding in Jupyter Lab, observing the data for a fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli, of an independent gaming company.  Generated a report summarizing the game's purchasing data including the following:

## Purchasing Analysis

Calculated and structured a DataFrame providing: 1) Number of Unique Items, 2) Average Purchase Price, 3) Total Number of Purchases, 4) Total Revenue.

## Purchasing Analysis by Gender

1.  Purchase Count
2.  Average Purchase Price
3.  Total Purchase Value
4.  Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

## Age Demographics

The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

1.  Purchase Count
2.  Average Purchase Price
3.  Total Purchase Value
4.  Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

## Top Spenders

Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

SN
Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value




## Most Popular Items

Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value




## Most Profitable Items

Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

Item ID
Item Name
Purchase Count
Item Price
Total Purchase Value



As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
