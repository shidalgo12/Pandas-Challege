# Pandas Coding

Read and analyzed a .csv file via Pandas coding in Jupyter Lab, observing the data for a fantasy game, of an independent gaming company. Generated a report summarizing the game's purchasing data including the following:

## Purchasing Analysis

Calculated and structured a DataFrame providing: 1) Number of Unique Items, 2) Average Purchase Price, 3) Total Number of Purchases, 4) Total Revenue.

## Gender Demographics

Calculations by Gender added to a DataFrame including: 1) Percentage and Count of Male Players, 2) Percentage and Count of Female Players, 3) Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.
